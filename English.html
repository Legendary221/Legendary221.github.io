        <h2>English</h2>
    </article>
 <p>In English class we made a book about our defining moments. It was nice to hear and see people see what defines them and who they are today. Many of my peers had their story in the book but mine didn't make it. My defining moment was too short they said to me. I mean it's a lot that defines me and I couldn't figure out how to do it. Many people think they know me me but it's a lot to get to know me. Alot of people try to get me but It make take them sometime to get me. So when the project came up I was so confused on what to do.</p>
