        <h2>MMA 2</h2>
    </article>
 <p>This class is absoutely fun. Like literally the things you can do on computer is honestly almost endless. This class have made webpages and created animations. For the animations we had to do smething either important to us or just something creative. To me I did legend of zelda because i'm a gamer and I love the character Link. Also The Legend of Zelda was one of the best games I've ever played. So I decided why not Legend of Zelda? So after all the frustration and help from my peers I was bale to do it. Many people struggled on making their animations and everything but we all manage to do it and was very proud of oursleves. We was extremly happy to show other parents and students becauseit was cool to show. We would have people coming up to us asking "how did you do that?" or "can you show me how to make that?". This project was extremely fun to me and the best project yet. </p>
